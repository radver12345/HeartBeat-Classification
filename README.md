# HeartBeat-Classification

In this project, a method has been suggested for classifying the heartbeat of people based on the ECG signal. Precisely, a deep CNN model has been trained for classifying arrhythmia. According to the accuracies obtained, it can be concluded that the network performs satisfactorily well and can be compared with the existing state of the art models.
